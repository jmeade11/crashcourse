    <h2>I enjoy life as a developer</h2>
    <p>Becoming a developer has changed my life.  I love what I do and feel fulfilled everyday. That hadn't always been the case, so I decided to change careers a year ago. I enrolled at General Assembly in Boston and learned to code.  Today, I'm employed full time as a front end developer with an awesome local startup.</p>
    <h2>I love being creative</h2>
    <p>The main reason I love being a developer is the creativity involved in building new things.  Being a developer is challenging and sometimes hard, but I work with great people who have helped me grow my skills and given me the latitude to explore a lot of new areas in design and development.</p>
    <h2>My portfolio of work</h2>
    <p>In the last year, I've built an impressive portfolio projects.  In addition to my day job, I've worked on several personal projects, helped friends and family build websites, and participated in several hackathons.  Have a look and let me know what you think!  You can reach me through any of my social media contacts below.</p>
